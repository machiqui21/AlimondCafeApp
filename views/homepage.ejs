      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        This café was born from the unwavering commitment of Jessette and Mike, a devoted couple whose dream was simple
        yet powerful: to serve the best and most affordable coffee to their neighborhood. Though Mike has since passed,
        his legacy lives on in every cup we brew and every smile we share.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their beloved sons have stood by them from the beginning—whether behind the counter or greeting customers, their
        helping hands and warm hearts have shaped this café into a true family endeavor.
